# jQuery Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [The DOM | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

-   [The DOM | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/). You may **ignore**
    these sections if you wish: "JavaScript can manipulate the DOM" and "Ajax
    and Templating".

-   [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/). You only need to complete level 1.

-   [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1cKlKM3jYI). The
point is to get to think about the DOM as a tree! The DOM is not source and
it's also not a rendered page.

## jQuery !== ?

Please name two things the DOM is not.

```md
<!-- The DOM is not the HTML in Atom and it is not the View Source either. -->
```

Is the information inside your Dev Tools the DOM? Why or why not?

```md
<!-- Technically it is not "the DOM", but it is a "visual representation of it",
meaning all the branches/trees are represented in the developer tools, so you can
select the branches and it'll highlight them, show you the elements that are
connected and which ones aren't, etc... to make changes to the DOM, you can use
jQuery or JavaScript to find nodes/elements/divs - whatever - and modify it
using the HTML DOM open() method. -->
```

In your own words, why do you think the DOM is important?

```md
<!-- to me, the DOM is important because it shows you everything that makes up
the web page you built.  it also can correct mistakes that the developer made
and allows JavaScript to execute on websites. -->
```
